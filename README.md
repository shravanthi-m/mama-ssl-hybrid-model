#MAML-SSL Hybrid Model
This is a research project aimed at improving model generalization for few-shot learning by creating a hybrid model combining Semi-Supervised Learning and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). This approach integrated pseudo-labels generated by a pre-trained model into the MAML training process. A comparative study was conducted to analyze whether the hybrid approach generalizes better as compared to MAML.
